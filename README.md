## üöÄ What is Klash.live?

**Klash.live** is a planned SaaS platform for gamers, by a gamer. It's being built to be the ultimate destination for hosting, managing, and participating in custom matches and tournaments across –ª—é–±–∏–º—ã–µ PC and mobile games. No more clunky Discord bots or messy spreadsheets. Just pure, streamlined competition.

## üéØ The Mission

This repository is more than just code. It's the logbook of a personal mission: to build a significant tech product from the ground up during my B.Tech journey.

This mission is a vehicle for learning and mastering:
* **Full-Stack Engineering:** Building a robust, scalable application.
* **Product Management:** Taking an idea from concept to launch.
* **Entrepreneurship:** The grind of building something from nothing.

This is the documentation of that grind.

## ‚ú® Core Features (The Vision)

- [ ] **Custom Lobby Creation:** Users can create private or public lobbies for any supported game.
- [ ] **Automated Tournament Brackets:** Single Elimination, Double Elimination, and Round Robin formats.
* [ ] **Cross-Platform Support:** Seamless experience for both PC and Mobile gamers.
- [ ] **Real-Time Leaderboards:** Track stats, wins, and rankings.
- [ ] **User Profiles & Identity:** Build your reputation as a top player.
- [ ] **Live Stream Integration:** A component for viewers to interact during live matches.
